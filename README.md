Shuki is a simple render engine for the practice of various real-time rendering techniques. It would be a low-level opengl encapsulation to service for the goal.


The features need to be implemented
1. ~~load the model~~
2. load various format images.
3. normal mapping
4. screen space ambient occlusion
5. screen space reflection
6. screen space subsurface scattering
7. Global Illumination
8. Post Processing HDR imaging
